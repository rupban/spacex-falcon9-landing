# SpaceX Falcon 9: Predicting First Stage Landing Success

## Project Overview
This capstone project aims to predict whether the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket's first stage will successfully land after launch. SpaceX offers launch services at around $62 million—far less than the $165 million typical of other providers—primarily due to its reusable first-stage technology. Predicting the success of these landings can help estimate launch costs and offer valuable data for competitors considering bids against SpaceX.
